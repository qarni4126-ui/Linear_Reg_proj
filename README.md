🧾 Insurance Charges Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle factors. Using the popular Insurance dataset, it explores how features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region influence the cost of insurance.

The goal is to understand the key drivers of insurance charges and develop a regression model that can make accurate predictions for new data.

🧠 Key Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations

Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn

Understand the impact of features like BMI and smoking on insurance charges

Explore the concept of regularization (Ridge Regression) and its effect on gradient descent and model stability

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used is insurance.csv, which contains 1,338 records with the following columns:

Column	Description
age	Age of the individual
sex	Gender (male/female)
bmi	Body Mass Index — a measure of body fat based on height and weight
children	Number of children covered by the insurance plan
smoker	Smoking status (yes/no)
region	Residential area (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
charges	The medical insurance cost billed to the individual
🔍 Project Workflow

Data Loading and Inspection – Import the dataset and explore its structure.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize relationships between features and charges using plots such as violin plots and regression plots.

Data Preprocessing – Encode categorical variables, scale numeric features, and split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Model Training – Fit a linear regression model to the training data and evaluate it using cross-validation.

Model Evaluation – Assess performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R² score.

Result Visualization – Plot prediction errors and compare predicted versus actual charges.

📊 Results Summary

The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of approximately 0.77, indicating that it explains about 77% of the variance in insurance charges.

Smoking status and BMI were the most influential predictors of higher medical costs.

While the linear model performed well, further improvement could be achieved through regularization (Ridge or Lasso Regression) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

💡 Key Insights

Individuals who smoke tend to have significantly higher insurance charges.

BMI is positively correlated with charges — higher BMI often leads to higher costs.

Regularization (λ or lambda in Ridge Regression) helps reduce model complexity.
Increasing λ shrinks the model coefficients, reducing the slope of gradient updates and stabilizing training.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📈 Evaluation Metric

Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual charges.

R² Score – Represents how well the model fits the data; higher values indicate better performance.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Implement Ridge and Lasso Regression to explore the effects of regularization (λ).

Use polynomial regression or tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for potential performance gains.

Develop a web interface or dashboard for real-time charge prediction.
